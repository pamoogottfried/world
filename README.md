# World Data Anaylsis

## Introduction

Welcome to the World Store Data Analysis project! This repository houses the documentation, SQL queries, and code for a comprehensive analysis of a world dataset using MySQL. 

## Objective



## Data Source

The dataset used in this project consists of world information, including country information, city details, and more.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL:** MySQL was the core tool used for data storage, querying, and analysis, allowing us to leverage the power of relational databases.
